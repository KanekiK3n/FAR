## Fix (NieR) Automata Resolution - Pirate-Friendly Version

A patched version of the FAR; with auto-updates proxied, you can update without worry with builds from this git.

### FAQ
- Why no sources?

```
I don't rebuild the FAR, i have patched with the x64dbg/ida pro, so... i don't have the patched source.
```

- No plans to start publish rebuild dll's?
```
Maybe, but for now, not necessary.
```

- The game close with Snake Sound (lol)
```
This isn´t a crash caused by the detection of the crack in the nier, Otherwise, this would have occurred to me.

Okay, and how to fix it?
- If are you using the CPY crack, isn't compatible, use the baldman v3.
- Download again the crack to have sure you have the lastest version of the baldman crack.
- if you think this alert sound it´s because the detected crack, isn´t this, you can try a outated version from the FAR.
- MSI Nahimic and Razer (Insert Any Product Name Here) are known to interfere with Special K (dxgi.dll), you may need to disable that software to use the mod
- Nothing Works?! Try the lastest version from the crack, my tests use the v3 baldman version.
- Nothing Again? You have any program that try hook/inject into the game? like the discord overlay? try disable anything like this.
- try set at [Steam.Log] the Silent=true
- Nothing... So... I can lend my shoulders to you cry if you need.
```

- I Don´t trust in you, but i need the mod.
```
